# Contributing to A-SIT Plus Open Source

</div>

We are happy to receive external contributions!
"Just" opening issues for encountered problems is greatly appreciated too!

## Reporting Issues

We welcome constructive feedback and enquiries of any kind! Just be sure to check existing issues first to avoid duplicates.
Please try to be as precise as possible and provide a reproducer (where applicable).

## Contributing Changes

We expect the contributor to hold all rights to the contributions they are about to commit.
We particularly condemn copyright infringement and expect contributors to respect this position and strictly observe applicable law!

We will then review the changes, provide feedback.
Once we agree that the PR is ready, we will approve it, and your PR will be merged.

This project **does not** require external contributors to sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA)!
Contributions are only subject to the terms of this project's license.

### Coding Conventions

We try to follow the [official Kotlin coding conventions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html) and expect the same from external contributors.
We don't have any automated checks in place and hence don't strictly enforce convention rules by hard, but we will manually check for obvious violations.
To put it plain and simple:

> When in Rome, do as the Romans do!
